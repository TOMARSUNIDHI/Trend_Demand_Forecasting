# Trend_Demand_Forecasting

# Project Overview:
Demand forecasting is an estimate of sales during a specified future period based on the proposed marketing plan and a set of particular uncontrollable and competitive force

# Goals: 
Accurate demand forecasting serves as the cornerstone of business success, wielding its influence across a multitude of operational facets. The ability to predict future consumer preferences and market trends empowers organizations to make informed decisions, optimize resource allocation, and maintain a competitive edge

 Load essential libraries for data processing and model building.
Import dataset for analysis.
The data structure and content were analyzed to identify patterns and anomalies
The relationships between the features are calculated
 highly correlated features to improve the model accuracy.
Transform skewed data for normalization
Convert categorical data into a numerical format.
The data were divided into training and testing sets.
Standardize data for consistent model performance.

# Conclusions
The firms could employ an ML-based approach to forecast the demand for achieving a higher level of accuracy. We showed that the higher level of demand forecast accuracy translates into both improved operational and financial performance outcomes
Forecasting the impact of sudden change in demand can help businesses understand the potential implications of any external factors that may influence their operations
